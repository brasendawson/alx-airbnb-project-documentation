# Backend Features and Functionalities Document

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive features and functionalities required for the backend of a property rental platform (similar to Airbnb). The backend will handle core operations including user authentication, property management, booking system, payments, and additional supporting features such as search, reviews, notifications, and admin tools. It adheres to the specified technical requirements, including RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), relational database usage, and integration with third-party services.

The backend will be built to ensure security, scalability, and reliability, with global error handling, logging, and support for file storage in cloud solutions like AWS S3 or Cloudinary.

## 1. User Authentication and Management

The backend must support secure user registration, login, and profile management, differentiating between guests, hosts, and admins via RBAC.

### 1.1 User Registration

- Allow users to sign up as either guests or hosts.
- Collect required fields: email, password (hashed), role (guest/host), and optional details like name and phone.
- Implement secure authentication using JWT for session management.
- Validate email uniqueness and send verification emails via third-party services (e.g., SendGrid or Mailgun).
- Handle guest-to-host upgrades if a user wants to switch roles post-registration.

### 1.2 User Login and Authentication

- Support login via email and password, with password verification against hashed values.
- Integrate OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) for social login, mapping external user data to internal user records.
- Generate and return JWT tokens upon successful login, including user role and ID in the payload.
- Implement token refresh mechanisms to maintain sessions without re-login.
- Support logout by invalidating tokens (e.g., via blacklisting or short expiration times).

### 1.3 Profile Management

- Allow authenticated users to retrieve their profile data.
- Enable updates to profile fields: name, contact info (phone, address), preferences (e.g., notification settings), and profile photos.
- Handle file uploads for profile photos, storing them in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Cloudinary) and returning secure URLs.
- Enforce RBAC: Guests can only update personal info; hosts can update hosting-related preferences; admins have full access.

### 1.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define roles: Guest (book properties), Host (manage listings), Admin (oversee platform).
- Restrict API endpoints based on roles (e.g., only hosts can create listings; only admins can manage users).
- Use JWT claims to enforce permissions at the middleware level.

## 2. Property Management

Hosts must be able to create, edit, and delete property listings, with support for rich details and media.

### 2.1 Add Property Listings

- Allow authenticated hosts to create new listings.
- Required fields: title, description, location (address, coordinates), price per night, amenities (array of options like Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly), availability calendar (dates or ranges), capacity (number of guests), and property type (e.g., apartment, house).
- Support multiple image uploads for properties, stored in cloud storage, with validation for file types and sizes.
- Automatically generate a unique listing ID and associate it with the host's user ID.
- Validate input data (e.g., positive price, valid dates) to prevent errors.

### 2.2 Edit Property Listings

- Allow hosts to update existing listings they own.
- Support partial updates (e.g., via PATCH) for fields like description, price, amenities, or availability.
- Handle updates to images: add new ones, delete existing ones, and reorder.
- Re-validate data on updates to maintain consistency.

### 2.3 Delete Property Listings

- Allow hosts to soft-delete or permanently remove their listings.
- Check for active bookings before deletion; prevent if conflicts exist.
- Cascade effects: Remove associated images from storage and notify affected bookings if necessary.

## 3. Search and Filtering

The backend must provide efficient querying of property listings for guests.

### 3.1 Search Functionality

- Implement a GET endpoint for searching properties.
- Filter by: location (e.g., city, radius search using coordinates), price range (min-max), number of guests, amenities (multi-select), and availability dates.
- Support keyword search on title and description.
- Use database indexing for performance on large datasets.

### 3.2 Pagination and Sorting

- Return results with pagination (e.g., limit/offset or page/size parameters).
- Support sorting by relevance, price (asc/desc), rating, or popularity.
- Include metadata in responses: total count, current page, and next/prev links.

---

## 4. Booking System

The backend must manage the full lifecycle of bookings, ensuring no overlaps and tracking statuses.

### 4.1 Booking Creation

- Allow authenticated guests to create bookings for available properties.
- Required data: property ID, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, total price (calculated based on nightly rate and duration).
- Validate against availability: Check for date overlaps with existing bookings using database queries.
- Prevent double bookings by locking the availability during creation (e.g., using transactions).
- Generate a unique booking ID and initial status (e.g., pending).
- Integrate with payments: Trigger payment intent creation upon booking submission.

### 4.2 Booking Cancellation

- Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on predefined policies (e.g., full refund if >7 days before check-in).
- Update booking status to "canceled" and release availability dates.
- Handle refunds via payment gateway integration.
- Notify involved parties via notifications system.

### 4.3 Booking Status Management

- Track and update statuses: pending (awaiting payment), confirmed (payment successful), canceled, completed (post-check-out).
- Provide endpoints for users to view their bookings filtered by status.
- Automate status transitions (e.g., mark as completed after check-out date via cron jobs).

### 4.4 Booking Retrieval

- Endpoints for guests to view their bookings, hosts to view bookings for their properties, and admins to view all.
- Include details: property info, dates, guest/host info, status, and payment details.
